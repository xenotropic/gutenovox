gutenovox
=========

Project to create an interface to show texts that are included in Project Gutenberg, but not in Librivox.

It depends on having gutenberg-catalog-sqlite https://github.com/emilis/gutenberg-catalog-sqlite

It expects to have gutenberg-catalog-sqlite run in the same directory such that the sqlite file is in gutenberg-catalog-sqlite-master/data/catalog.sqlite relative to its directory
